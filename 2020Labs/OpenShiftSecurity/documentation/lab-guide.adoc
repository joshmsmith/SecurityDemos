_Application CI/CD Pipeline_

(Automation is amazing for security, including automated infrastructure creation and deployment. If you're curious about how this lab comes to be, you can find the Ansible role that deploys everything link:https://github.com/redhat-cop/agnosticd/tree/development/ansible/roles/ocp4-workload-security-compliance-lab[here].)

The "image hardening" pipeline scans and creates a foundational block, or "golden image" that developers would use to build their applications on top of (in this case, it's Java). A link:https://catalog.redhat.com/software/containers/detail/5c3592dcd70cc534b3a37814?container-tabs=overview[Universal Base Image (UBI)] is used as the...well, the foundation of the foundation. Compliance and vulnerability scans are performed, and if the compliance percentage is less than 80% or if or more vulnerabilities are found, the pipeline will fail. !! The application pipeline is then triggered, using this newly built and vetted base image. !!

The application CI/CD pipeline takes this golden image and creates a running application by combining it with the source code for that application. We've talked about the security scanning done in this pipeline, and the diagram above also describes it.

=== So...what code are we running??

In this workshop, we'll build a https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot[spring boot] application that mimcs an online store. The code for the application will be in the workshop's Gogs repository, but since that repository will go away when our lab environment does, you can also find it https://github.com/RedHatDemos/SecurityDemos/tree/master/2020Labs/OpenShiftSecurity/spring-boot-angular-ecommerce[here].

=== Explore the Image Hardening Pipeline

These sections explain each piece of the pipeline (called "stages").

==== Checkout
Checks the image building code out the Gogs git repository. This includes a container image specification file along with bash scripts that perform hardening of the image. The scripts are derived from the remediaton scripts generated by OpenSCAP, in accordance with the Security Technical Implementation Guideline (STIG) for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7. Once the code is checked out (the equivalent of downloading to the Jenkins container/server), Jenkins can proceed with the rest of the pipeline.

==== Build / Harden
Creates an image from the inputs retrieved from the git repository. The base image used is the UBI 7 image from Red Hat. The UBI image is free to use and is maintained by Red Hat - and is regularly updated with remediation when new security vulnerabilites (CVEs) are discovered.

==== Push Candidate Image
Uses skopeo to push the newly built candidate image into the Quay image repository.

==== OpenSCAP Scans
Runs the Maven SonarQube plugin to send the code, unit test results, and code coverage metrics to the SonarQube server for static code analysis.

==== Archive to Nexus
The result of the build is the creation of a Java ARchive, or JAR, file. This file is the Java bytecode that the web application needs to run. We send this JAR file to Nexus for storage so that it can be retrieved in the future if needed (rather than having to rebuild the same version of code). This also allows our artifacts to be shared easily to other interested parties. The supported (paid) version of SonaType Nexus also can analyze any dependencies used by our uploaded code to look for known vulnerabilities.

==== Build Image
During this step, we use the *Dockerfile* provided along with our source code to construct a new docker image. A *Dockerfile* contains the instructions for how to build a container - it's called a "Dockerfile" because it began with instructions for how to build a Docker image.  building a docker image. The Dockerfile we are using to deploy the ecommerce application takes a base, Red Hat provided OpenJDK 1.8 image (Open JDK is the Java Development Kit - the runtime required to execute a Java application) and superimposes our executable JAR file on top of it to form a new Docker image, capable of running our application.

==== Push Image to Quay
In this stage we take the docker image that we just built and push it into Red Hat Quay - our centralized image registry.  Once the image is pushed to a registry, it can be made available to interested parties and promoted to different OpenShift or kubernetes based clusters. Quay has also been configured with Clair - which will perform a vulnerability scan of any images pushed to Quay. The Clair report will become available shortly after the image has been pushed into Quay.

==== OpenSCAP Scans
This will perform two OpenSCAP scans. A vulnerability scan and a Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) Security Technical Implementation Guideline (STIG) compliance scan. Both reports will be collected by Jenkins and made available for viewing.

==== Compliance Gate
This gate will explicitly examine the OpenSCAP compliance scan results and verify that at least 80% of the STIG compliance requirements have passed.

==== Vulnerability Gate
This gate will explicitly examine the OpenSCAP vulnerability scan results and verify that there are no CVEs detected in the built image. Note that this pipeline will immediately fail if a CVE is detected, however one could also configure the pipeline to simply pause and notify the appropriate people to inspect the results and make a determination as to whether the pipeline should continue.

==== Configure Stage Project
Configures the OpenShift staging project (i.e., userid-stage) so that the image can be promoted into it

==== Smoke Test
This stage performs a simple smoke test. The image is deployed in OpenShift and runs the `java -version` command. If the command returns successfully, the smoke test is passed.

==== Golden Image
At this point in the pipeline, the image has passed all tests and can be marked as a golden image within the Red Hat Quay image repository.

==== Trigger Application Pipeline
Now that a new, vetted base image has been created, the pipeline can trigger the application pipeline. The application pipeline will use this golden image as the base image for building the application. Note that the application pipeline reruns the same compliance/vulnerability tests to verify no potential security issues were introduced in the process of creating the application image.

The following sections describe each of the stages in the application CI/CD pipeline that we will be running during this lab.

==== Checkout
This stage checks the source code out the gogs git repository. Once the code is checked out, we can proceed with the rest of the pipeline.

==== Build
This stage uses Apache Maven to build our spring boot Java application from source. If the build fails, our pipeline will terminate since we cannot proceed with the remaining steps

==== Run tests
This stage again uses Maven to run any unit tests that were written. Unit tests are important in that they prevent our code from becoming brittle.  Without unit tests we can not be confident that any changes made to the source code will not adversely affect other parts of the code. By running unit tests we can also collect metrics in terms of what percentage of the code is being exercised by the tests. This is called code coverage and will be visible within SonarQube.

==== SonarQube Scan
During this stage we run the Maven SonarQube plugin to send the code, unit test results and code coverage metrics to our sonarqube server for static code analysis.

==== Archive to Nexus
The result of our build is the creation of a Java ARchive, or JAR file. This file is the Java bytecode that is run to deploy our web application. We send the JAR file to nexus for storage so that it can be retrieved in the future if needed (rather than having to rebuild the same version of code). This also allows our artifacts to be shared easily to other interested parties. The supported version of SonaType Nexus also has the ability to analyze any dependencies (libraries) used by our uploaded code to detect potential known vulnerabilities they may introduce.

==== Build Image
During this step, we use the *Dockerfile* provided along with our source code to construct a new docker image. A *Dockerfile* contains the instructions for building a docker image. The Dockerfile we are using to deploy the ecommerce application takes a base, Red Hat provided OpenJDK 1.8 image (Open JDK is the Java Development Kit - the runtime required to execute a Java application) and superimposes our executable JAR file on top of it to form a new Docker image, capable of running our application.

==== Push Image to Quay
In this stage we take the docker image that we just built and push it into Red Hat Quay - our centralized image registry.  Once the image is pushed to a registry, it can be made available to interested parties and promoted to different OpenShift or kubernetes based clusters. Quay has also been configured with Clair - which will perform a vulnerability scan of any images pushed to Quay. The Clair report will become available shortly after the image has been pushed into Quay.

==== OpenSCAP Scans
This will perform two OpenSCAP scans. A vulnerability scan and a Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) Security Technical Implementation Guideline (STIG) compliance scan. Both reports will be collected by Jenkins and made available for viewing.

==== Deploy
This step will deploy the application into your Openshift user project, which will serve as a development environment. This environment is typically used by developers to verify applications come up as expected and also for performing automated integration tests.

==== OWASP ZAP Scan
During this stage a Jenkins Agent Pod will be started within OpenShift for the purposes of performing an OWASP ZAP baseline scan against the running container image.  The scan will analyze and crawl starting from the main page of our web application, searching for potential vulnerabilities lurking within javascript including things such as potential cross-site scripting (XSS) exploits. The resulting report will also be published by Jenkins.

==== Configure Stage Project
Configures the OpenShift staging project (i.e., userid-stage) so that the image can be promoted into it

==== Promote to Stage?
This step pauses the pipeline and waits for an authorized person (e.g., a QA test lead) to confirm promotion into a higher level environment.

==== Configure Prod Project
Configures the OpenShift production project (i.e., userid-prod)

==== Promote to Prod?
Similar to the previous _Promote to Stage?_ step, requiring manual intervention before promoting the application image to an even higher level environment.

+
. Browse the `openscap-compliance-report.html` report and the `openscap-cve-report.html` reports.
+
. Take a look at the source for the Jenkinsfile and hardening scripts located in gogs within the `hardening_pipeline` folder
+
. Open the Dockerfile within the `hardening_pipeline` folder and select the edit button
+
image:images/lab2.4-jenkins-hardening-edit-dockerfile.png[]
. Next we set the image to an old version, to verify the pipeline fails. Change the `FROM` statement on line 1 to
+
```
FROM registry.access.redhat.com/ubi7/ubi:7.6-73
```
+
image:images/lab2.4-jenkins-hardening-image-version.png[]
+
. Comment out the following line in the Dockerfile as well.
+
```
RUN yum update -y && rm -rf /var/cache/yum/ /var/tmp/* /tmp/* /var/tmp/.???* /tmp/.???*
```
+
image:images/lab2.4-jenkins-hardening-yum-update.png[]
+
. Comment out the `yum update -y` line in the `fix-2.sh` remediation script as well:
+
image:images/lab2.4-jenkins-hardening-fix-2-yum.png[]
+
Skipping this `yum update` will prevent the image build from applying CVE fixes.
+
. Click the `Commit Changes` button on the bottom of the page.
+
. From Jenkins, restart the hardening pipeline.
+
. Notice that the compliance gate passed since the hardening script was able to perform compliance remediaton. Go to the blue ocean view again and look at the vulnerability report under `Artifacts`
+
. Revert the FROM statement in the Dockerfile back to:
+
```
FROM registry.access.redhat.com/ubi7/ubi:latest
```
+
and uncomment the `yum update` lines in the `Dockerfile` and `fix-2.sh` script.
+
. Rerun the pipeline to make sure it is once again successful.
