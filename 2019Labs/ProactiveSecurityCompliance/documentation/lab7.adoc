= Implementing DevSecOps to Build and Automate Security into the Application in a Secure CI/CD Pipeline
:toc:

== The Goal

The goal of this lab is to learn how to automate and build security into an application and build a link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_factory[secure software factory] that combines several security tools (including SonarQube, OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP), Red Hat Quay, Clair and the Open Security Content Automation Protocol (OpenSCAP)) into a Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipeline via Jenkins. We will also automatically detect security and compliance issues in a controlled way for automated security compliance at scale.


== Introduction

The benefits of DevOps and Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) have been demonstrated with great success over the years. Security was initially treated as a second class citizen - left until the end of the SDLC. With the advent of DevSecOps, security is put front and center - it's addressed in terms of people, processes, _and_ technology. Security tools can be integrated right into the build process - you can even break the build with security gates if security requirements are not met.

This lab will focus on some of the technologies used to implement automated security compliance controls within a typical CI/CD application pipeline.

The security tools we mentioned have already been installed and configured for the lab, containerized within the OpenShift cluster. Here is a general idea of the pipeline we'll be stepping through during our lab:

This pipeline will: checkout Java code from a git repository, build the artifact from that code, run automated tests, perform a static code analysis scan with SonarQube, send the artifact to Sonatype Nexus for storage, build a Docker image containing our application, push the image to Quay for image layer security scanning by Clair, perform OpenSCAP scans, deploy the application to OpenShift so that it can be scanned for web vulnerabilities by OWASP ZAP, and then pauses before promoting the application to other OpenShift projects to allow us to only promote if we are satisfied with the results. The following sections describe the tools we'll be using in more detail.


==== Gogs
link:https://gogs.io/[Gogs] is the Go Git Service - a *Github-like git server* written in Go.

Gogs is great ligtweight git server for use in lab environments such as this. Most enterprise projects would use more fully-featured git repositories such as GitHub Enterprise, Gitlab, Atlassian BitBucket, etc.

==== Jenkins
link:https://jenkins.io/[Jenkins] is a *CI/CD tool* written in Java primarily for *artifact build automation and deployment* - including automated testing. This fucntionality is typically implemented with pipelines.

While there are other tools available for CI/CD pipelines, Jenkins is the most widely used. A containerized version is provided with OpenShift and integrates natively with it.

==== Apache Maven
link:https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Maven[Apache Maven] is a *project build and management* tool. Based on the concept of a project object model (POM), Maven can manage a project's build, reporting, and documentation from a central piece of information.

Maven provides an opinionated framework defining a structure and layout for Java source code. By following this structure, a myriad of plugins can be used to simplify the build, documentation, testing and deployment of source code. The pipeline in this lab uses maven to build and package our source code as well as transmit the application to Nexus (described below) and submit static code analysis requests to SonarQube (also described below).

==== Nexus
link:https://www.sonatype.com/product-nexus-repository[Sonatype Nexus] is a *repository manager*. It allows you to proxy, collect, and manage your dependencies so that you are not constantly juggling a collection of Java ARchives (JARs).

When we build our application as a part of the lab, the resulting JAR file will be stored within nexus.

==== SonarQube
SonarQube does *static code analysis* and detects common code issues - including security issues - and provides a dashboard reporting its findings. 

==== Quay / Clair
Red Hat Quay is a private *container registry* that stores, builds, and deploys container images. Clair *analyzes images stored in Quay for security vulnerabilities*. The pipeline will send our application image to Quay where it will be automatically scanned for security vulnerabilities by Clair.

==== OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP)
_The OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP) is one of the worldâ€™s most popular free security tools and is actively maintained by hundreds of international volunteers. It can help you automatically find security vulnerabilities in your web applications while you are developing and testing your applications. Its also a great tool for experienced pentesters to use for manual security testing._

In our pipeline, we will stand up an instance of our web application then point OWASP ZAP to that instance so that it can perform a baseline security scan.

=== Sample application used in this lab exercise

For the purposes of this lab, we will be examining a simple, all-in-one https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot[spring boot] application. The application presents a simple e-commerce web user interface, which is backed by a self-contained restful API.

== Lab 2: Explore the pipeline stages


The following sections describe each of the stages in the CI/CD pipeline that we will be running during this lab.


==== Checkout
Checks the source code out of the Gogs git repository. 

==== Build
Uses Apache Maven to build our Spring Boot Java application from source. If the build fails, our pipeline will terminate since we cannot proceed with the remaining steps.

==== Run tests
Uses Maven to run any unit tests that were written. Unit tests are important in that they prevent our code from becoming brittle.  Without unit tests we can not be confident that any changes made to the source code will not adversely affect other parts of the code. By running unit tests we can also collect metrics in terms of what percentage of the code is being exercised by the tests. This is called code coverage and will be visible within SonarQube.

==== SonarQube Scan
Run the Maven SonarQube plugin to send the code, unit test results and code coverage metrics to our SonarQube server for static code analysis.

==== Archive to Nexus
The result of our build is the creation of a Java ARchive, or JAR file. We send the JAR file to Nexus for storage so that it can be retrieved in the future if needed (rather than having to rebuild the same version of code). This also allows our artifacts to be shared easily to other interested parties. The supported version of SonaType Nexus also has the ability to analyze any dependencies (libraries) used by our uploaded code to detect potential known vulnerabilities they may introduce.

==== Build Image
During this step, we use the *Dockerfile* provided, along with our source code, to construct a new Docker image. A *Dockerfile* contains the instructions for building a docker image. The Dockerfile we are using to deploy the ecommerce application takes a base, Red Hat provided OpenJDK 1.8 image (Open JDK is the Java Development Kit - the runtime required to execute a Java application) and superimposes our executable JAR file on top of it to form a new Docker image, capable of running our application.

==== Push Image to Quay
In this stage we take the Docker image that we just built and push it into Red Hat Quay - our centralized image registry.  Once the image is pushed to a registry, it can be made available to interested parties and promoted to different clusters. Quay has also been configured with Clair - which will perform a vulnerability scan of any images pushed to Quay. The Clair report will become available shortly after the image has been pushed into Quay.

==== OpenSCAP Scans
This will perform two OpenSCAP scans - a vulnerability scan and a Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) Security Technical Implementation Guideline (STIG) compliance scan. Both reports will be collected by Jenkins and made available for viewing.

==== Deploy
Deploy the application into your Openshift userX project, which will serve as a development environment. This environment is typically used by developers to verify applications come up as expected and also for performing automated integration tests.

==== OWASP ZAP Scan
During this stage a Jenkins Agent Pod will be started within OpenShift for the purposes of performing an OWASP ZAP baseline scan against the running container image.  The scan will analyze and crawl starting from the main page of our web application, searching for potential vulnerabilities lurking within javascript including things such as potential cross-site scripting (XSS) exploits. The resulting report will also be published by Jenkins.

==== Configure Stage Project
Configures the OpenShift staging project (i.e., userid-stage) so that the image can be promoted into it

==== Promote to Stage?
This step pauses the pipeline and waits for an authorized person (e.g., a QA test lead) to confirm promotion into a higher level environment.

==== Configure Prod Project
Configures the OpenShift production project (i.e., userid-prod)

==== Promote to Prod?
Similar to the previous _Promote to Stage?_ step, requiring manual intervention before promoting the application image to an even higher level environment.

== Lab 4: Update the base image and source code

An old base image was used to build the application, we will update the base image to use a newer version. This will reduce the number of vulnerabilities that are detected. We will also update the source code to remove the vulnerabilities detected by SonarQube.

. Navigate to your source code repository in Gogs (at http://gogs-ocp-workshop.apps.{GUID}.example.opentlc.com) and login if you haven't already (userid / openshift)
+
. Click on the *SecurityDemos* repository under *My Repositories*
+
image:images/lab7.5-gogs-repo.png[]
. Click the *Dockerfile*
+
image:images/lab7.5-gogs-dockerfile.png[]
. Click the edit icon (small pencil) and change the image version from 1.0 to latest.
+
The current line in the Dockerfile is referring to an older image, with associated vulnerabilities.  The latest image we are using will resolve many (potentially all) of these known vulnerabilities. You can explore the https://registry.access.redhat.com[Red Hat Container Catalog] to search for images provided by Red Hat as well as inspect their current security posture.
+
       FROM registry.access.redhat.com/redhat-openjdk-18/openjdk18-openshift:latest
